        <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

     <ul>
        <li> <a href="#">Variable Declaration </a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class= "purple"> var x;</span></li><br>

        <li><a href="#"> Variable Assignments </a>  Assignments operator assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = asignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class= "purple"> var x=10; </span> </li><br>

        <li><a href="#">Data tables </a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate in the variables you need to know the data type. There are six data tables that are JavaScript primitives: Boonlean-  <span class= "purple"> true </span> or <span class= "purple" false>;</span> null- <span class= "purple" null>;</span>  aka nothing; Number- <span class= "purple" 42;</span> </li> or <span class= "purple"> 3.14159;</span> String- <span class="purple"> 'Coding Dojo Rocks!'; </span> Array - <span class= "purple"> [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; </span> and Object - <span class= "purple"> {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}; </span> <br>

        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform differnt actions for differnt decisions - hitting differnet code blocks based on valies or conditions that have been met. You can use cinditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class= "purple"> if </span> a special condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class= "purple"> else is;</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class= "purple"> else;</span> we execute this block of code;<br>

        <li><a href= "#"> Loops </a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they are all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action soem number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That is a loop!<br>
        <li><a href= "#"> Function </a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
